Diary entry 1

I don't have empathy for anyone. It's strange but im only living because i dont feel ready to die yet. That is, if i try kill myself, i might survivce. then what? life would be even worse than it already is. i might be disbaled or something and then my familywould find out and stuff its horrible. i dont wanna get help but theyd force me to and that petriefeis me even more than i already am. i dont know. maybe im making excuses. what if i do succeed? that will be good. i dont wanna leave savanna but i do know that id be the only one sad about that. she doesn't like me. in fact, she has so moany friends and people and stuff she doesn't need em. i wish i never met her sometimes
