If statements:
A simple comparisio is:
if car == 'something':
	print("me")
else:
	print("summersault")
We can negate capital letters in an if statements by making the variable lower case in the condition. This won't make the variable lowercase in the entire progam:

car = 'YOU'
if car.lower()=='you'
print("peg me")

inequalites are the same as in java, too:
!=

Numerical comparisons are the same, too,.
Greater than, equal to and stuff work with numebrs as well

AND and OR:
you can check if two statemnts are the same by just using and inbetween both statemnts:
if age==21 and age> 1
You can use parethases around each statment to make them look cooler

we use or if we want to be true:
if age== 21 or age > 1
We can check if something is in a lsit:
mushrooms = ["hey","heyno"."nigger"]
if "hey" in mushrooms
print("fart")

to chekc if it'snot there, we say:
if 'person' not in mushrooms:
print("pepesadge")

If and Elif else chains:
Chains are just sequences. And if then an else is an if-else chain.

Python runs an if, elif and else in order. If one of thsoe tests come true, then it'll skip the other tests. It's usueally 3 statements.

if something < 4
 print("me")
elif < 18
 print("something else")
else
print"me")

look how else is the only one without a statement next to it. Also, this is bad. We can work with price or another value and use that in an all together output:

if something < 4
 value = 0
elif < 18
value = 1
else
value = 3
print(f"Your ticket price, loser, is {value}")

We can put uncapped elif statemnets. an else statement isn't necessary at all. else applies to the failed tests in the previous blocks, so that can mess up your program entirely

We use a series of if statemnetse if we wanna test a bumch of things with out skipping anything.
