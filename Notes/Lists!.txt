Everything to do iwith lists:
to change the value of something in a list, we jsut say:
me[0] = 'something'

To add stuff to a list..
Apeedning the elemtents to the end of a list:
me.append('hey') - this will add the thing to the end of a list
and increases the lists size

We can build lists just by appending them throughout the app.

Inseting elements inot the list:
We can take a osition and put something new there. It just shifts everything os nothing is deleted and everything moves one to the right

me.insert(3, 'apple')

Removing stuff:
we can use del STATEMENT:
del me.something[3]

We can use pop() METHOD:
this doesn't just delete stuff: it allows you to still work with it. We store the thing we popped into a variable:

popped_person = me.pop()
print(popped_person)

It pops the last item in the list

We can put a parameter into the parameters to determine the index we want to pop:
popped_person = me.pop(0)

We can use the remove() METHOD to remove things by value, and not by position:

me.remove('hey you so fiiine')

We can also put the thing we want to delete in a variable, and say to remove that. Like a maekshift pop:
mesage = 'hey you so fiiine'
me.remove(message)
print(f"{message} was ass")

Note that remove removes the first instance of the thing you want to remove. We need to use a loop to get rid of all of em.

We can sort lists permanentley with:
sort()
we can reverse this by passing the argument reverse=True to the sort method

cars.sort()
cars.sort(reverse=True)

we can sort things impermanentley using the sorted() method
this sorts it but not forever. we use it in conjunction with print
print(sorted(cars))

it can also accept a reverse=True argument

We can reverse a list using the reverse() method, but it's not alpahebtical or anything, It's just in reverse:
cars.reverse()

We can find the lenght of a list using the len() method
it returns an integer, not the final index of the list
The list or whatever you want the length for is the parameters
