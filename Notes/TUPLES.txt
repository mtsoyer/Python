Tuples:

Lists that cannot have their values changed. So we just instantiate them using round bracketes instead of square ones:

something = ('hey', 'you','run')
And we can play with them the same way. The only thing about them is to instantiate one variables:
something = ('hey',)
We need that comma

We can overwrite tuples by instantiating a variable of the same name with different values:
something = 2,3,4,5
